          <h5 class="card-title">Critical Thinking and Media Literacy</h5>
          <p class="card-text">Learning Goal:<br>
            Equip students with skills to critically evaluate media content, recognize bias, and make informed decisions. This topic will also foster awareness of how media influences perceptions and behaviors in society.<br>
            
            Main Themes and Activities<br>
            1. Understanding Media Influence on Society<br>
            
            Overview:<br>
            Focuses on the role of media in shaping public opinion, influencing trends, and setting cultural narratives. Students learn to recognize different forms of media influence, including advertisements, news, and social media.<br>

            Learning Activities:<br>
            
            Media Content Analysis Workshop: Students bring in examples of media content (ads, news articles, social media posts) and analyze the intended messages, the persuasive techniques used, and potential biases.<br>
            Influence Map Creation: Students create a map showing how different media sources influence their own daily lives and perceptions, fostering self-awareness of media impact.
            Skills Developed:<br>
            Recognition of media’s role in shaping opinions and understanding of various media techniques used to influence audiences.<br>
            
            2. Developing Critical Thinking through Fact-Checking<br>
            
            Overview:<br>
            This theme introduces fact-checking techniques to help students distinguish between credible and unreliable sources. It includes analyzing credibility indicators like author reputation, publication standards, and verifiable evidence.<br>
            
            Learning Activities:<br>
            
            Fact-Checking Simulation: In groups, students receive articles or social media posts and use online resources to verify claims. This exercise builds familiarity with reliable sources and verification strategies.
            Critical Questioning Exercise: Students practice asking questions about media content, focusing on key aspects like the purpose of the information, the intended audience, and potential biases.<br>
            Skills Developed:<br>
            Ability to critically evaluate the accuracy and credibility of information, strengthening decision-making based on facts rather than assumptions.<br>
            
            3. Recognizing and Responding to Bias in Media<br>
            
            Overview:<br>
            Focuses on identifying various types of bias (e.g., political, cultural, commercial) in media and understanding how biases affect the portrayal of events and ideas. Encourages students to consider how media bias can shape their own perceptions.<br>
            
            Learning Activities:<br>
            
            Media Comparison Exercise: Students analyze the same news story from different sources, noting differences in tone, language, and focus. They discuss how bias affects the presentation of facts.<br>
            Personal Bias Reflection: Through journaling, students reflect on their own biases and how these may influence their interpretation of media content, fostering awareness of personal viewpoints.<br>
            Skills Developed:<br>
            Enhanced ability to identify and understand different types of media bias, along with personal reflection on biases and perspectives.<br>
            
            Evaluation of Learning Outcomes:<br>
            Students will complete a Media Literacy Portfolio, including analyses of different media sources, a fact-checking report, and personal reflections. They also present a Final Project where they apply critical thinking and media literacy skills to investigate and present on a media-related issue of their choice.</p>
