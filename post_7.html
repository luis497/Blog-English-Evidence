          <h5 class="card-title">Crime and Punishment</h5>
          <p class="card-text">Learning Goal: <br>
            Encourage a reflective understanding of justice, focusing on how crime and punishment affect both individuals and society, and exploring different approaches to ethical decision-making.<br>
            
            Main Themes and Activities
            1. Understanding Crime and Its Social Implications<br>
            
            Overview:<br>
            This section dives into the social context of crime, discussing root causes, social impact, and the societal responses. It aims to help students analyze crime beyond just statistics, encouraging them to think about underlying factors and the role of society in both prevention and response.<br>
            
            Learning Activities:<br>
            
            Community Impact Map: Students create a visual map illustrating the impact of crime on different community groups (e.g., families, schools, businesses) to identify the broader social consequences.<br>
            Case Comparison Exercise: Students compare two case studies of similar crimes in different social contexts, discussing how factors like poverty, education, and community support shape outcomes.<br>
            Skills Developed:<br>
            Critical thinking about the causes and effects of crime and awareness of social factors influencing criminal behavior.<br>
            
            2. Exploring Justice Systems and the Role of Punishment<br>
            
            Overview:<br>
            This theme introduces various justice systems and their approaches to punishment, contrasting methods like retribution, rehabilitation, and restorative justice. It encourages students to evaluate how these systems align with societal values and the ethical challenges they present.<br>
            
            Learning Activities:<br>
            
            Justice System Comparison Project: In small groups, students research and present different justice systems from around the world, exploring how punishment reflects cultural and ethical values.<br>
            Ethics in Sentencing Workshop: Through role-play, students take on roles of judge, defendant, and victim, considering ethical aspects in different sentencing scenarios (e.g., minor vs. major offenses).<br>
            Skills Developed:<br>
            Ability to understand justice from multiple cultural perspectives and analyze the effectiveness of different punitive approaches.<br>
            
            3. Reflecting on Ethical Dilemmas in Punishment<br>
            
            Overview:<br>
            Focuses on specific ethical dilemmas in the justice system, such as the death penalty, life imprisonment, and juvenile detention. Students are encouraged to form and defend their ethical views, considering human rights and societal impacts.<br>
            
            Learning Activities:<br>
            
            Ethical Dilemma Discussion Groups: Students work in small groups to debate real-life dilemmas (e.g., cases involving life sentences for minors), discussing the implications on individuals and communities.<br>
            Argument Development Exercise: Students write a reflective essay supporting their stance on a specific ethical issue in punishment, using researched evidence and ethical reasoning.<br>
            Skills Developed:<br>
            Enhanced ethical reasoning skills and an ability to articulate and support opinions on complex social issues.<br>
            
            Evaluation of Learning Outcomes:<br>
            Each student completes a Self-Reflection Journal where they record insights and shifts in perspective throughout the unit. Additionally, a Final Presentation allows them to summarize their understanding of crime, punishment, and ethical responsibility within society.</p>
